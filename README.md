These files represent my submitted Capstone project in October 2025. The Excel_Dashboard and Power_BI_Dashboard subdirectories each contain brief Word documents that give details to my process. The MySQL_Workbench subdirectory only contains the .sql file. I included commentary about the actions I took with each query I performed; so that is where you will find commentary on my MySQL Workbench actions. Also, for the Power BI .pbis file, the source data locations have been updated to reflect connection to the data files uploaded into this folder. So, you will be able to open the Power Query Editor in Power BI to see what actions I took in preparing the data to be used in the dashboards.

Hopefully, this will demonstrate my capabilites, thus far. I am constantly seeking to increase my skill level. This Capstone repository represents my humble beginnings. Feel free to reach me at JohnTisGrateful@gmail.com with any questions you have. Thank you for stopping by to see my work!
